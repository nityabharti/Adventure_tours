          <br />
          <p>
            Bihar is a state in East India, bordering Nepal. It is divided by
            the River Ganges, which floods its fertile plains. Important
            Buddhist pilgrimage sites include the Bodhi Tree in Bodhgaya's
            Mahabodhi Temple, under which the Buddha allegedly meditated. In the
            state capital Patna, Mahavir Mandir temple is revered by Hindus,
            while Sikhs worship at the domed, riverside Gurdwara of Takht Sri
            Harmandir Sahib Ji

          <h2>Nalanda</h2>
          <p>
            Nalanda is the oldest university in India, Nalanda is an important
            site to visit in Bihar. A perfect reminisce to the time of
            flourishing Gupta and Pala period, Nalanda is an acclaimed tourist
            attraction in Bihar. It is believed that the last and most famous
            Jain Tirthankara, Mahavira spent 14 monsoon seasons here. Even,
            Buddha is said to have delivered lectures near the mango grove in
            Nalanda. The fame of this education centre was to an extent that
            Hieun Tsang, the famous Chinese traveller visited here and stayed
            for atleast two years here. Even, I-tsing another famous Chinese
            voyager stayed at Nalanda for about 10 years, AND such was the glory
            of this place. Today most parts of Nalanda lie in ruins but the
            place is surely worth exploring!

          <p>
            Built in 1545 AD in the memory of Emperor Sher Shah Suri, this tomb
            is an excellent example of Indo-Islamic architecture in India.
            Architecturally splendid and erected at the middle of an artificial
            lake, this sandstone structure is worth a visit in Bihar.

          <h2>Gaya</h2>
          <p>
            Amongst the most famous places in Bihar is Gaya, which is a Hindu
            pilgrimage hub and a transit point for Buddhist pilgrimage centre of
            Bodhgaya. It is believed that it was here under the tree that Buddha
            attained enlightenment. Gaya is a busy city situated on the bank of
            River Phalgu and it is replete with many temples and historic sites
            dating back to different eras that stand as the evidence to the
            successful rule of Maurya and Gupta dynasty here. The glory of Gaya
            was extended so much so that even Hiuen Tsang could not resist
            mentioning it in his travelogues.

          <h2>Munger</h2>
          <p>
            Dubbed as the seat of Bihar School of Yoga, Munger is yet another
            place that is popular amongst the tourists in Bihar. The history of
            Munger dates back to Aryans, who called Munger the ‘Midland’ for
            their settlement. For yoga buffs, Munger is not an unknown name,
            thus we can expect a large foreign crowd thronging this place. The
            present day Munger is a twin city, which comprises of Munger and
            Jamalpur. Reckoned to be one of the oldest cities of Bihar, Munger
            was once the capital of Mir Kasim before it fell into the hands of
            British. The place has several historic relics that further add to
            the charm here.

            Better known as the World Peace Pagoda, Vishwa Shanti Stupa proudly
            stand at the historic city of Rajgir. It is one of the 7 Peace
            Pagodas built in India and is certainly a must visit in Bihar. The
            pagoda was built in 1969 to spread the message of peace and
            non-violence. Marked by four statues of Buddha that reflects four
            important phases of Buddha’s life – birth, enlightenment, teaching
            and death, this Peace Pagoda is amongst the finest examples of
            Japanese architecture in India.

          <p>
            Reckoned to be one of the two important Buddhist learning centres in
            Bihar, Vikramshila was established by King Dharampala. It is
            believed that the king was displeased with the depleting quality of
            Nalanda, thus he decided to establish another better institute for
            learning. Vikramshila now lies in ruins but renovation work has
            begun now. During the excavation, Buddhist monasteries, stupas and
            several wall carvings have been unveiled here
